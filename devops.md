# Traditional Software Development Approaches

## Waterfall model

The waterfall model is a traditional software development model that uses a linear and sequential approach for software development.

| Advantages                                                   | Disadvantages                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| - Easy to use<br />- Cost effective<br />- Time saving <br />- Easy testing<br />- Suitable for small projects<br />- Managerial control | - Risky and uncertain.<br />- Not suitable for complex project.<br />- Final product available only at the end.<br />- Not suitable for projects with changing requirements.<br />- Difficult to make changes in the testing phase. |

## Agile Model

Agile model focuses on process adaptability and customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of the working software product.

| Advantaged                                                   | Disadvantaged                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| - Dynamic response to requirements<br />- Cost effective<br />- Superior quality product<br />- Direct communication between stakeholders<br />- Best suited for large and long term projects<br />- Minimum resource requirement | - Poor document<br />- Difficult to estimate time and effort for complex project.<br />- Risky due to the ever evolving characteristics.<br />- Difficult to predict the expected results when requirements are unclear. |

## Relationship Between Agile and DevOps

The benefits of using Agile with DevOps are:

- Replace non-human steps using automation tools
- Improve collaboration between the teams
- Automate to create a potentially shippable increment

## DevOps Lifecycle

The DevOps is based on five phases, as follows:

- Continuous Development: manifests planning and coding. The scope of the project is determined during the planning and developers build the code.
- Continuous Testing: is the phase in which the application is rigorously tested for bugs. Automation test tools such as TestNG, JUnit, Selenium, and others are used for continuous testing. Docker Containers simulate the test environment in continuous testing. Jenkins assist in conducting automation of the test procedure. Automation testing saves a lot of time and work, unlike manual testing.
- Continuous Integration: is an essential phase of DevOps, which deals with
  software development. Frequent changes are made to the source code. Include Unit Testing, Integration Testing, Code Review, Code Packaging. The existing code is continuously and seamlessly put together with the new code, which leads to continuous development of software.
- Continuous Deployment: means that the implemented code is correctly deployed across all production servers. New code is continuously deployed, and configuration tools are required to manage it effectively. Tools is Chef, Puppet, Ansible, SaltStack, Codeship, AWS CodeDeploy, Terraform. Containerization plays a pivotal role in the deployment process.
- Continuous Monitoring: includes all operational aspects, where critical information
  about the software's use is recorded and analyzed to derive analytics. Tools is Nagios, Sensu, DataDog, AWS CloudWatch, Grafana, splunk.

## Benefits of DevOps

- Assured Rapid Deployment: Updates and improvements that happen faster and more frequently will not only please your customers but will also benefit your company.
- Balanced Working Environment: DevOps improves the working environment and brings stability in the workspace and strengthens productivity.
- Drastic Improvement over Quality: Product quality enhances due to the impact of coordination between development and operations teams, as well as timely gathering of user input.
- Repetitive Task Is Automated: DevOps has a range of benefits because it facilitates quick problem discovery, correction, and automation. The team has a lot more time to think out of the box.
- Proactive Growth of the Business: DevOps has made it feasible to attain scalability by improving the overall productivity of the business to stay ahead of the competition on a global scale.
- Continuous Delivery: All teams are responsible for ensuring stability and adding new features to deliver the software uninterrupted.
- Minimal Cost of Production: DevOps helps the team minimize costs for administration and production by keeping both maintenance and new updates together.
- Higher Productivity: It allows communication among team members, allowing them to concentrate more on their areas of expertise, removing barriers, and encouraging collaboration.

## DevSecOps

DevSecOps emerged from DevOps to integrate the management of security throughout the development process.

Collaboration between developers and security teams resulted in the development of a security as code culture.

**Benefits**

- Rapid and Cost-effective Software Delivery: Both time and costs can be reduced by minimizing the repetitive process of addressing security issues after delivery. Efficient and cost-effective due to integration of security.
- Improved Proactive Security: The cybersecurity process is involved in the development cycle. Security problems are taken up as soon as they are identified.
- Accelerated Security Vulnerability Patching 
- Automation Compatible with Modern Development: Automation can be adopted in cybersecurity testing.
- Repeatable and Adaptive: Repeatable and adaptive processes are applied constantly across the environments, changing adaptive requirements to dynamic ones.
